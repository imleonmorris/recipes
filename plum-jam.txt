Ingredients:
- 1/2 pound plums, diced (about 3 cups)
- tablespoons chia seeds

Directions:
1. Combine plums and 1/4 cup water in a medium saucepan.
2. Set over medium heat, cover and cook, stirring frequently, until fruit is very soft, about 15 minutes.
3. Remove from heat. Stir in chia seeds and let cool slightly.
4. If needed, transfer plum mixture to a food processor and pulse until a chunky jam forms.
5. Spoon into 1 large or several smaller glass jars, cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours to allow the jam to thicken.
6. The jam will keep refrigerated for up to 1 week.
